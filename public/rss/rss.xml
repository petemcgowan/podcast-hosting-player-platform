    <h4>Upbeat Neo Vinyl, Swimming Downstream - Underground House, EP11</h4>

    <p>
      Hi I'm Pete Burquette, also known as Diplomatic Enjoy, and you are
      listening to the Underground House Funk n Techno podcast. The 1st song is
      by Session Victim called Never Forget on the Delusions of Grandeur label.
      I'll let the music take over the controls, back in a litte bit
    </p>
    <br />

        (00:00) &#8211; &#8221;Never Forget&#8221; by Session Victim on Delusions of
        Grandeur

        <br />
        (02:03) &#8211; &#8221;Can't Die, Soul Singer&#8230;&#8221; by Diplomatic Enjoy

        <br />
        (05:06) &#8211; &#8221;Lovelee Dae (Original)&#8221; by Blaze on Classic Music
        Company
        <br />
       (10:01) &#8211; &#8221;Higher African Rhythms&#8221; by Diplomatic Enjoy
    </p>

    <p>
      Lovelee Dae is a total house classic - is this the best house song of all
      time? This is the original mix not remastered or anything like that.
      There're been many mixes of this song, but it basically the original can't
      be improved on - bar the odd snippet edit I've done here, which doesn't
      really count as anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's just something about the melancholic singing, which beautifully
      juxtaposes the strident house beat beneath. This is a real 6am song, the
      sun coming up, grab the morning paper and a big dirty baguette sandwich.
    </p>

    <p>
      The song before this was Can't Die, Soul Singer by Diplomatic Enjoy and
      yes that is moi. I starting doing DJ mixes to begin with (not just a love
      of music, and because I was finding so much cool music) but also to white
      label try out my own tracks to see if I got it right.
    </p>

    <p>
      11th episode of this podcast, I finally got two that fit the bill. This
      white label approach is how pretty much all house n techno gets exercised,
      sitting amongst the classics seeing how it behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      If anyone has any feedback on the podcast at all feel free to DM me at
      diplomaticenjoy on Instagram, let me know what you think. The next track
      is another white label, not out yet called, Higher African Rhythms but I
      could well change the name by the time I release it&#8230;
    </p>

    <br />
    (14:12) &#8211; &#8221;Trespassers&#8221; by Newworldaquarium on Delsin

    <br />
    (18:50) &#8211; &#8221;Higher&#8221; by Black Loops on Neovinyl
    <br />
    (22:45) &#8211; &#8221;Fresh&#8221; by Daft Punk on Soma/Virgin

    <p>
    This is of course Daft Punk from their legendary Homework album released on
    Soma and Virgin. Soma is the original Scottish label run by the lads from
    Slam, a techno duo.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before that was Higher by Black Loops on Neovinyl, a label who seem defunct
    at the moment. I say come back! I love the mastering that the Neovinyl guy
    Baldo does, he's done all the good Black Loops ones I M O.
     </p>
    <p>
    And before that again you heard another house classic Trespassers by
    Newworldaquarium, which brilliantly samples Sergio Mendes and the New Brasil
    77 - "the Real thing".
    </p>
    <p>
    All these songs and songs like em are on the ever revolving "Underground
    House" playlist , I think I'm calling it "Underground House (black loops,
    moodymann, soul, funk" &#8230; a catchy name you're totally gonna remember.
    Not helped by the fact that I change the name all the time. It's the one
    with people at a festival on the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think in order to be found through search on Spotify you need to be
    famous, but I completely forgot my famous badge on my tent. I'll go back and
    get it now</p>

    <br />
        (25:43) &#8211; &#8221;Casa(Axel Boman Dub Mix)&#8221; by Dinky on Crosstown
        Rebels
        <br />
        (27:10) &#8211; &#8221;Not Seeing Is A Flower&#8221; by Lone on Ancient
        Astronauts
        <br />
        (30:55) &#8211; &#8221;Verloren&#8221; by Computer Data on Lost Palms (a sub
        label of Shall Not Fade)

    <p>
      This is Verloren by Computer Data on Lost Palms label, which is a
      sub-label of Shall Not Fade. This in itself is a sub-label of Will Totally
      Shrink in the Wash. featuring I'm gonna have to lose some weight if I'm
      gonna fit into that again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that was Not Seeing a Flower by Lone on Ancient Astronauts. See the
      flower people, see the flower. Unless you're allergic to that kind of
      thing, in which case, avoid the flower completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      And before that was Axel Boman's Dub Mix of Dinky's Casa. That was
      released on Crosstown Rebels. I'm pretty sure that the vocal sample was
      that of everyone's favourite sketchy uncle, Timothy Leary, who consumed
      enough acid in his time to become his own planet and currently orbiting
      the sun at 55,000 miles an hour.
    </p>

    <br />
    (35:48) &#8211; &#8221;Back in the Days&#8221; by Coeo on Toy Tonics

    <br />
    (39:20) &#8211; &#8221;Street Disco&#8221; by Lux Experience on Masterworks Music
    <br />
    (43:41) &#8211; &#8221;Wan Poku Moro(Onur Ozer Remix)&#8221; by 2000 And One on
        100% Pure
    <br />

    <p>
      This is the Onur Ozer Remix of 2000 And One's "Wan Poku Moro" on 100%
      Pure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that was Street Disco by Lux Experience on Masterworks Music. Black
      Madonna made this song her own (I think it was a Boiler Room mix),
      although I notice no-one seems to mention the people who actually wrote
      the song originally, which was of course originally Disco Party in the
      Street by Mastermind.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love their edit here, it's simple but very effective. It's actually hard
      to tell the difference.
    </p>

    <p>Before that was Back in the Days by Coeo on Toy Tonics.</p>

    <p>
      And the final song coming up is Feeling Good by Laurent Garnier and
      Chambray on Rekids.
    </p>

    <br />
    (47:00) &#8211; &#8221;Feelin' Good&#8221; by Laurent Garnier and Chambray on
        Rekids
        <br />

    <p>
      I just noticed I've never asked anyone to subscribe. I never quite
      understood the please subscribe thing. If people want to subscribe, they
      know how to do that, they don't need me telling them to press the button!
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't mind either way. As long as I don't know it's all good. Otherwise
      it's like leaving a dog in a car with the windows rolled up. Us podcast
      hosts need your attention, leave those windows rolled down so we can stick
      our heads out the window.
    </p>

    <p>Till next time people, have a beautiful day!</p>
    <br />

    <p>

    <h4>Upbeat Neo Vinyl, Swimming Downstream - Underground House, EP11</h4>

    <p>
      Hi I'm Pete Burquette, also known as Diplomatic Enjoy, and you are
      listening to the Underground House Funk n Techno podcast. The 1st song is
      by Session Victim called Never Forget on the Delusions of Grandeur label.
      I'll let the music take over the controls, back in a litte bit
    </p>
    <br />

        (00:00) &#8211; &#8221;Never Forget&#8221; by Session Victim on Delusions of
        Grandeur

        <br />
        (02:03) &#8211; &#8221;Can't Die, Soul Singer&#8230;&#8221; by Diplomatic Enjoy

        <br />
        (05:06) &#8211; &#8221;Lovelee Dae (Original)&#8221; by Blaze on Classic Music
        Company
        <br />
       (10:01) &#8211; &#8221;Higher African Rhythms&#8221; by Diplomatic Enjoy
    </p>

    <p>
      Lovelee Dae is a total house classic - is this the best house song of all
      time? This is the original mix not remastered or anything like that.
      There're been many mixes of this song, but it basically the original can't
      be improved on - bar the odd snippet edit I've done here, which doesn't
      really count as anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's just something about the melancholic singing, which beautifully
      juxtaposes the strident house beat beneath. This is a real 6am song, the
      sun coming up, grab the morning paper and a big dirty baguette sandwich.
    </p>

    <p>
      The song before this was Can't Die, Soul Singer by Diplomatic Enjoy and
      yes that is moi. I starting doing DJ mixes to begin with (not just a love
      of music, and because I was finding so much cool music) but also to white
      label try out my own tracks to see if I got it right.
    </p>

    <p>
      11th episode of this podcast, I finally got two that fit the bill. This
      white label approach is how pretty much all house n techno gets exercised,
      sitting amongst the classics seeing how it behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      If anyone has any feedback on the podcast at all feel free to DM me at
      diplomaticenjoy on Instagram, let me know what you think. The next track
      is another white label, not out yet called, Higher African Rhythms but I
      could well change the name by the time I release it&#8230;
    </p>

    <br />
    (14:12) &#8211; &#8221;Trespassers&#8221; by Newworldaquarium on Delsin

    <br />
    (18:50) &#8211; &#8221;Higher&#8221; by Black Loops on Neovinyl
    <br />
    (22:45) &#8211; &#8221;Fresh&#8221; by Daft Punk on Soma/Virgin

    <p>
    This is of course Daft Punk from their legendary Homework album released on
    Soma and Virgin. Soma is the original Scottish label run by the lads from
    Slam, a techno duo.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before that was Higher by Black Loops on Neovinyl, a label who seem defunct
    at the moment. I say come back! I love the mastering that the Neovinyl guy
    Baldo does, he's done all the good Black Loops ones I M O.
     </p>
    <p>
    And before that again you heard another house classic Trespassers by
    Newworldaquarium, which brilliantly samples Sergio Mendes and the New Brasil
    77 - "the Real thing".
    </p>
    <p>
    All these songs and songs like em are on the ever revolving "Underground
    House" playlist , I think I'm calling it "Underground House (black loops,
    moodymann, soul, funk" &#8230; a catchy name you're totally gonna remember.
    Not helped by the fact that I change the name all the time. It's the one
    with people at a festival on the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think in order to be found through search on Spotify you need to be
    famous, but I completely forgot my famous badge on my tent. I'll go back and
    get it now</p>

    <br />
        (25:43) &#8211; &#8221;Casa(Axel Boman Dub Mix)&#8221; by Dinky on Crosstown
        Rebels
        <br />
        (27:10) &#8211; &#8221;Not Seeing Is A Flower&#8221; by Lone on Ancient
        Astronauts
        <br />
        (30:55) &#8211; &#8221;Verloren&#8221; by Computer Data on Lost Palms (a sub
        label of Shall Not Fade)

    <p>
      This is Verloren by Computer Data on Lost Palms label, which is a
      sub-label of Shall Not Fade. This in itself is a sub-label of Will Totally
      Shrink in the Wash. featuring I'm gonna have to lose some weight if I'm
      gonna fit into that again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that was Not Seeing a Flower by Lone on Ancient Astronauts. See the
      flower people, see the flower. Unless you're allergic to that kind of
      thing, in which case, avoid the flower completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      And before that was Axel Boman's Dub Mix of Dinky's Casa. That was
      released on Crosstown Rebels. I'm pretty sure that the vocal sample was
      that of everyone's favourite sketchy uncle, Timothy Leary, who consumed
      enough acid in his time to become his own planet and currently orbiting
      the sun at 55,000 miles an hour.
    </p>

    <br />
    (35:48) &#8211; &#8221;Back in the Days&#8221; by Coeo on Toy Tonics

    <br />
    (39:20) &#8211; &#8221;Street Disco&#8221; by Lux Experience on Masterworks Music
    <br />
    (43:41) &#8211; &#8221;Wan Poku Moro(Onur Ozer Remix)&#8221; by 2000 And One on
        100% Pure
    <br />

    <p>
      This is the Onur Ozer Remix of 2000 And One's "Wan Poku Moro" on 100%
      Pure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that was Street Disco by Lux Experience on Masterworks Music. Black
      Madonna made this song her own (I think it was a Boiler Room mix),
      although I notice no-one seems to mention the people who actually wrote
      the song originally, which was of course originally Disco Party in the
      Street by Mastermind.

      Headphone Cloud Party, Boogie in Smallville - Underground House, EP10
    </h4>

    <p>
      Hi this is Pete Burquette, aka Diplomatic Enjoy, rolling out the
      Underground House tent.
    </p>

    <p>
      (00:00)&#8221;Aviator&#8221; by Jesper Ryom on Power Plant Records

      <br />
      (02:06)&#8221;High Energy&#8221; by Ross From Friends on Ostgut Ton

      <br />
      (04:30)&#8221;Got2B&#8221; by Move D on Hybrid Minds

      <br />
      <br />
      (07:29)&#8221;Ya never know&#8221; by Moomin on Closer (which I think
      might be his own label?)

      <br />
      (09:55)&#8221;Orchid&#8221; by Dj Kush Boogie on Lobster Theremin

      <br />
      (12:25)&#8221;From Disco to disco&#8221; by Whirlpool Productions - this
      needs explanation! It sounds like they fired up the tape recorder after a
      serious night on the town that wasn't ending anytime soon

      <br />
      <br />
      (16:20)&#8221;If you want it&#8221; by Park Hye Jin on Clipp.Art a cool
      little Australian label, I think they're Australian, maybe they're
      orbiting the Earth and distributing from there.

      <br />
      (18:10)&#8221;On my side&#8221; by Adryiano on Soul Notes

      <br />
      (21:10)&#8221;Ivoire&#8221; remixed by Folamour on Umami, original track
      is by Kio Amachree from 1981

      <br />
      <br />
      (23:50)&#8221;Handsome Frank&#8221; by Oskar Offermann & Moomin by White,
      which is Oskar's Berlin label

      <br />
      (26:10)&#8221;Baustelle&#8221; by Black Loops on Neovinyl Recordings (a
      Barcelona-Berlin label)

      <br />
      (29:05)&#8221;Sixth Sense&#8221; by Josh Wink and Ursula Rucker, remixed
      by Louie Vega on Philadelphia's Ovum Recordings owned by Mr Wink and King
      Britt of Digable Planets.

      <br />
      <br />
      (31:30)&#8221;Blazing&#8221; by Cubenx on Infiné

      <br />
      (34:40)&#8221;Last Home&#8221; by Yulia Niko on Rebellion
    </p>

    </h4>

    <p>
      Hi this is Pete Burquette, aka Diplomatic Enjoy, rolling out the
      Underground House tent.
    </p>

    <p>
      (00:00)&#8221;Aviator&#8221; by Jesper Ryom on Power Plant Records

      <br />

      <br />
      (04:30)&#8221;Got2B&#8221; by Move D on Hybrid Minds

      <br />
      <br />
      (07:29)&#8221;Ya never know&#8221; by Moomin on Closer (which I think
      might be his own label?)

      <br />
      (09:55)&#8221;Orchid&#8221; by Dj Kush Boogie on Lobster Theremin

      <br />
      (12:25)&#8221;From Disco to disco&#8221; by Whirlpool Productions - this
      needs explanation! It sounds like they fired up the tape recorder after a
      serious night on the town that wasn't ending anytime soon

      <br />
      <br />
      (16:20)&#8221;If you want it&#8221; by Park Hye Jin on Clipp.Art a cool
      little Australian label, I think they're Australian, maybe they're
      orbiting the Earth and distributing from there.

      <br />
      (18:10)&#8221;On my side&#8221; by Adryiano on Soul Notes

      <br />
      (21:10)&#8221;Ivoire&#8221; remixed by Folamour on Umami, original track
      is by Kio Amachree from 1981

      <br />
      <br />
      (23:50)&#8221;Handsome Frank&#8221; by Oskar Offermann & Moomin by White,
      which is Oskar's Berlin label

      <br />
      (26:10)&#8221;Baustelle&#8221; by Black Loops on Neovinyl Recordings (a
      Barcelona-Berlin label)

      <br />
      (29:05)&#8221;Sixth Sense&#8221; by Josh Wink and Ursula Rucker, remixed
      by Louie Vega on Philadelphia's Ovum Recordings owned by Mr Wink and King
      Britt of Digable Planets.

      <br />
      <br />
      (31:30)&#8221;Blazing&#8221; by Cubenx on Infiné

      <br />
      (34:40)&#8221;Last Home&#8221; by Yulia Niko on Rebellion
    </p>

    <p>EP 08. Funk and Hip hop this episode&#8230;</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to episode 8 of Underground House, Funk n Techno podcast, I'm Pete
      Burquette, this is Underground Funk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Got 23 funk and hip hop tunes, of which there are 10 edits, 4 remixes and
      1 unreleased track.&nbsp;&nbsp;All new spins &#8230;
    </p>
    (00:00)&#8211; Them Changes - Thundercat (Brainfeeder) (DE Edit)
    <br />
    (02:45) &#8211; Do It - Beastie Boys (Grand Royal Records)
    <br />
    (05:58) &#8211; Chilled. by Speechless (Speak less, Listen More)
    <br />
    <br />
    (07:10) &#8211; In Flux by DJ Shadow (Island Records) (DE Edit) - Released
    before &#8221;Endtroducing&#8221; was released, set the template. I'm
    playing an edited down, sped up version of it, as the original is 12
    minute long epic, more for home listening and space travel, and is
    really good.

    <br />
    (12:40) &#8211; Stepping Into Tomorrow - Madlib (Blue Note Records) (DE Edit) -
    classic &#8221;Shades of Blue&#8221; album. I've done a DJ edit of it
    here, but the song itself is a reworking of Donald Byrd's 1974 song of
    the same name.

    <br />
    (18:00) &#8211; Erykahs Gun - DJ Harrison Stashboxxx album on Ropedope label

    <br />
    <br />
    (18:55) &#8211; Just Kissed My Baby - The Meters (DE Remix) Rhino, Reprise,
    Warner Records (and other record labels too). It's the Meters, so it's
    like trying to find a source for the Bible &#8230; in this case, of FUNK

    <br />
    (22:49) &#8211; Cabaceira BY FloFilz (Melting Pot Records)
    <br />
    (24:22) &#8211; While You Doooo - Teebs (Brainfeeder records)

    <br />
    <br />
    (26:02) &#8211; Vibrations - Al Dobson Jr. (Rhythm Section International)

    <br />
    (27:54) &#8211; Break - Jurassic 5 (Interscope Records) From the classic Power
      In Numbers album

    <br />
    (31:00) &#8211; You've Heard - Daedelus (All City Records from Dublin, Ireland)
    (DE Edit)

    <br />
    <br />
    (33:13) &#8211; Hell Yes - Beck (Interscope) on Guero album (DE Edit)

    <br />
    (36:11) &#8211; Wider, Git Hub - Ratgrave who are Max Graef, Julius Conrad
      (Apron Records)

      <br />
      (38:34) &#8211; Do It (till you're satisfied) by B.T. Express (Roadshow Records)
      (DE Remix)

      <br />
      <br />
      (43:28) &#8211; Beatless Reunion - Diplomatic Enjoy Unreleased track by me.
      Actually made to have a beatless start and end for an earlier version of
      this mix, like a mix tool, but ended up doing the mix differently but
      still keeping the track in

      <br />
      (46:00) &#8211; B Boys Will B Boys - Black Star (Rawkus Entertainment) (DE
      Edit).

      <br />
      (48:35) &#8211; Bubble and Slide (Nightmares on Wax Remix of Sabres of Paradise
      (DE Edit) on Warp Records

      <br />
      <br />
      (52:34) &#8211; Jazz 104 by Max Graef (Tartelet Records) (DE Edit). Jazz 104 is
      a reworking of &#8221;Popular Instruments&#8221; by Paul Parrish and
      James Lansing sound, a cool find, where I think this is the drummer of
      Bread on a hi-fidelity system demonstration record, which I think used
      to come with the 1st component home stereo systems! I combined both of
      these tracks so there's a drum intro, so that I could then DJ blend.

      <br />
      (54:05) &#8211; Party Pts 1 and 2 - Midnight Movers from their Follow The Wind
      album on Buddah Records. This is a lost classic where no version exists
      of this on Spotify and no good vinyl copies exist anywhere, so I was
      lucky to be able to pull a remix out of it by playing a new bass, drum
      parts, etc while keeping as much of the original as possible. I almost
      gave up, but I think has ended up being the edit or remix I like the
      most.
      <br />
      (57:40) &#8211; Beep It by Japanese legend Cornelius from his/their 'Sensuous'
      album (DE Edit). I saw these play live in Sydney, Australia, a while
      back, they were excellent.

      <br />
      <br />
      (1:02:27) &#8211; Power to the People - Public Enemy (Def Jam
      Recordings) (DE Remix) This is basically the instrumental version of
      Power to the People with extra percussion added in, different mastering,
      it's kind of a remix. The original is on the deluxe version of Fear of a
      Black Planet, which if you like Public Enemy has lots of little
      intrumentals and alternative versions, all of which stand well on their
      own right because of the Bomb Squad's, PE's production team, &#8221;wall
      of samples&#8221; production approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Songs in this mix (or ones like them) can be found in the
      &#8221;Underground Funk (Afro soul, 70s, beats, breaks, stones
      Throw)&#8221; playlist on Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud and Deezer
    </p>
    <p>Cover is Mr. Sly Stone</p>

    <p>EP 06. Pure techno. Minimal talking, DJ mix focus&#8230;</p>

    <br />
    Tracklist:
    <br />
    <p>
    Welcome to Underground Techno, this is Diplomatic Enjoy aka Pete Burquette.  It's pure techno this episode, nothing but underground.
    </p>
    The first song you hear was "Rote 2", a collaboration between Daniel Avery and "Vult Fass", out on Vult Fass's "Bleed" label.
  </p>
  <p>

    And the song crashing into it right now is "Cubismo 8.3" by Architectural, also out on Architectural records.
  </p>
  <p>

    As you can hear, this is beat-matched live and fairly raw, the emphasis is on energy, or whatever you're having.   Tchuss!
  </p>
    Tracklist:
    <br />
    (00:00) &#8211; Rote 2 - Rote                                                           (BleeD)

    <p>
    Normally I'd hear a mouse move a pebble in the garden, but in this case sure if the mouse is having the craic, let him have it.
  </p>

    <br />
    (27:30) &#8211; Void 23 (Carl Craig Re Edit)  - Appleblim & Ramadanman   (Aus Music)
    <p>
    Carl Craig is not only one of original innovators of techno, but has continued to put incredible tunes over the years, and has never lost his touch.  Check out pretty much anything by him, you can't lose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Polar Inertia is Voiski's alter ego.  I'm going through a bit of a Polar Inertia phase at the moment
  </p>
    (30:00) &#8211; Mzuzu Chant  - Martinez                                           (Cadenza)
